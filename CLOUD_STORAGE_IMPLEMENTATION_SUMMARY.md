3. Submit the form
4. Check email for download link
5. Test file download

### Expected Responses:

**Health Check (Configured):**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "Cloud storage is working correctly",
  "cloudStorage": true,
  "localStorage": false,
  "provider": "AWS S3",
  "bucket": "oisdrive-attachments",
  "region": "us-east-1"
}
```

**Health Check (Not Configured):**
```json
{
  "status": "not_configured",
  "message": "Cloud storage not configured. Using local storage fallback.",
  "cloudStorage": false,
  "localStorage": true
}
```
